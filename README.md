# Coming Soon Template

I created a simple coming soon page that you can use as you wish in your projects.                    
I just ask to be written in the credits if you use my template ^^

# What does it look like ?


# How to install and modify colors ?

It's very simple, install the folder on your desktop and open the "index.html" in your browser!

- To change the color around in background go in "style.css" and go from line "14" to "51" to modify the surrounding colors.

- To change the color of the text "coming soon..." go in "style.css" go to line "75".

- To change the color of the discord logo go to "index.html" and go to line "39".
